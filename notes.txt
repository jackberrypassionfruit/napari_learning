to zoom from console:
>>> viewer.camera.zoom = new zoom level

to set default brush size:
>>> list(viewer.window._qt_viewer.controls.widgets)[-1].brush_size = 1

Running 
>>> viewer.add_labels(labeled, name='my_core')
make all continuous bodies show the same color, even when their values are different

In Napari, right-clicking an image layer and hitting "Convert to Labels" gives correct color
How can I do that programatically and at image load?
Also wtf is a label layer? I should read the article


Create a napari viewer using just label
>>> viewer = napari.view_labels(labeled)


Get active layer (for exporting?)
>>> active_layer = viewer.layers.selection.active
